# Selenium Web Scraper  

This project automates web scraping using Selenium WebDriver in Java. It navigates through specific web pages, extracts data, and saves it as JSON files. The `TestCases` class contains test methods to scrape hockey team statistics and Oscar-winning films, storing the results in the `output` directory. The project uses TestNG for test execution and Jackson for JSON processing. To run the tests, ensure Java, Gradle, and Chrome are installed. Execute the test cases using `./gradlew test`. The `Wrappers` class simplifies interactions with web elements.
